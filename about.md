# <cy>Brody</c> (Prophecy Engine)

<cg>Your chill gaming buddy</c> who drops <cp>prophecies</c> during gameplay... which <cr>always come true</c>. <cb>Always correct</c>.

Brody sits quietly in the corner, watching you play. Occasionally, he'll predict the future. Maybe gravity will flip? Maybe you'll get tiny? Maybe... the level just ends?

<co>Customize his behavior</c> in the settings, unlock <cj>God Mode</c> traits, and discover the hidden <cp>???</c> mode.

<cy>Have fun!</c>
